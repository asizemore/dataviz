This repository is a collection of some of my favorite visualizations I created over the years. Others not included within this repo include interactive graphics on the [Black In STEM](https://www.blackinstem.net/list-demographics.html) page, and interactive plots used to help my students understand the [normal distribution](https://github.com/asizemore/ENM_375_lecture_code/tree/master/lecture_10_02_20_2020).

Please navigate to ... or ... to see all of the above visualizations in action. Enjoy!!
